When working on a project, the objects from other dependent projects are not provided to us already instantiated (i.e., initialized with new),  or for various reasons they cannot be automatically initialized using new. 
As a result, we often end up manually creating many objects with new throughout the code. This utility was developed as a solution to that problem.
